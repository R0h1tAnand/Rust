# Rust Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of simple Rust programs, each demonstrating a fundamental concept of the Rust programming language. Each folder is a separate Cargo project focused on a specific topic.

## Structure

- `_00_hello-world/` — Basic "Hello, World!" example
- `_01_integers/` — Working with integer types
- `_02_Floats/` — Working with floating-point numbers
